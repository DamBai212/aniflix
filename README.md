# Welcome to AniFlix
 
 This is a Netflix clone using React with node and mongoDB, deployed on heroku. Because of my love for anime I've decided to build this based on my favorite anime tv shows. As time progresses I'll be updating the ReadME to match the overall jounrey of building AniFlix

## Available Scripts
